#The string "first.line.txt" is stored in the variable my_file_name (line 6)
#Next we use the variable my_file_name as the argument to the open () function and store the resulting file object to the 
#variable my_file (line 7)
#Finally we call the read() method on the variable my_file and store the resulting string in the variable my_file_contents.

#The variable names are arbitary so we could have used other names, for example, what follows is the same as the above,
#except that it is harder to understand.
#NB. The file name, first_line.txt is not an arbitary name, it must correspond to the name of a file on the hard drive of
#your computer otherwise it will cause an error.
