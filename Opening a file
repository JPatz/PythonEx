#As in the real world, we have to open a file before we can read what is inside.
#In Python we use open() which takes one argument - a string - which contains the name of the file and - and returns a file object.
#The way in which we use a file object is different to strings and numbers. We use methods.

my_file = open("first_line.txt")
file_contents = my-file.read()
print(file_contents)
