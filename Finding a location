#Instead of counting the number of 'n' letters in our word, we might want to know their position
#We can do this by using find() which takes a simple string argument and returns a number which is the position at which the 
#substring first appears.
#Remember that we count from zero rather than one.

#Output:
#3
#6
#-1 since the location of the substring doesn't exist.


word ="spontaneous"
print (str(word.find("n")))
print (str(word.find("ne")))
print (str(word.find("x")))
