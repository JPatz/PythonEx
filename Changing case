#Converting a string to lower case by using a method that belongs to strings.
#A method is like a function but it belongs to the string type.

#This will print my name all in lower case characters.
#If I want to print my name in upper case, just replace lower() with upper().
#The lower() method does NOT change the variable, instead it returns a copy of the variable in lower case.

#The lower() method belongs to strings, therefore it can only be used on variables that are strings.

my_name = "Jenny"
print(my_name.lower())
