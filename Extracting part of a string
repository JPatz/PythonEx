#We can use this method if we have a long string but only require a portion of it - called taking a substring.
#To get a substring we follow the variable name with a pair of [] which enclose a start and stop position, separated by a colon.

#The output will be:
#nt
#spon
#aneous

word = "spontaneous"

#print letters three to five
print(word[3:5])

#Positions start at zero not one
print(word[0:4])

#If we leave out the stop position it goes to the end of the string
print(word[5:])
